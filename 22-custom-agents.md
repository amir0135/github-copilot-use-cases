## Custom Agents

In addition to the built-in modes, you can define custom agents in .agent.md files. These modes allow you to tailor Copilot's behavior for specific workflows, such as generating implementation plans or conducting research. Custom modes include predefined tools and instructions, making them reusable across projects.

### Practical Tips

- Use Ask Mode for quick clarifications or brainstorming.
- Leverage Edit Mode for controlled, reviewable code changes.
- Opt for Agent Mode when tackling large-scale or loosely defined tasks.
- Define Custom Modes for specialized workflows to enhance productivity.

These modes are designed to complement your expertise, helping you code faster and more effectively while maintaining control over your workflow

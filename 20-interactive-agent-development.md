This example demonstrates how the Agent can read an issue from GitHub and implement its requirements step by step, ensuring a structured and interactive development process.

Here is the issue link: [https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPO_NAME>/issues/1](https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPO_NAME>/issues/1)

**Prompt in Agent mode:**
github issue #1 <YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPO_NAME>
